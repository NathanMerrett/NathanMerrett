- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @NathanMerrett
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things Python! Something that gives me a challenge to learn something new.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™ve built some strong data science skills, and more recently have been building out a strong base on ML engineering, meaning i can build strong ML models AND push them into prod.
